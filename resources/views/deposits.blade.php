                                <h2 class="mb-3">6-Month Fixed Deposit</h2>
                                <div class="text">
                                    The 6-Month Fixed Deposit is an excellent option for individuals seeking a short-term
                                    investment with guaranteed returns. This type of deposit allows you to lock in a
                                    competitive interest rate for a period of six months, providing a secure way to grow
                                    your savings without the risks associated with more volatile investments.

                                    **Key Features:**
                                    - **Fixed Interest Rate:** One of the most significant advantages of a 6-month fixed
                                    deposit is the fixed interest rate. This means that regardless of market fluctuations,
                                    the interest rate you lock in at the time of deposit remains unchanged for the entire
                                    six-month period.

                                    - **Short Commitment:** This deposit is perfect for those who may need access to their
                                    funds in the near future. With a maturity period of only six months, you can quickly
                                    access your savings without lengthy waiting times.

                                    - **Guaranteed Returns:** Unlike stock market investments that can fluctuate widely, a
                                    6-month fixed deposit offers guaranteed returns. You know exactly how much interest you
                                    will earn by the end of the term, allowing for better financial planning.

                                    - **Low Risk:** This deposit type is ideal for conservative investors. Your principal
                                    amount is secure, making it a low-risk option for growing your savings.

                                    **Ideal For:**
                                    The 6-month fixed deposit is suitable for individuals who want to save for an upcoming
                                    expense, such as a vacation, home renovation, or a major purchase. It's also a good
                                    choice for those who want to park their money for a short time while still earning
                                    interest.

                                <h2 class="mb-3">12-Month Fixed Deposit</h2>
                                <div class="text">
                                    The 12-Month Fixed Deposit is designed for individuals looking to maximize their savings
                                    over a longer term while enjoying a higher interest rate than shorter-term options. This
                                    deposit offers a fixed interest rate for a full year, making it an attractive choice for
                                    those willing to commit their funds for a longer duration.

                                    **Key Features:**
                                    - **Higher Interest Rates:** The 12-month fixed deposit typically offers higher interest
                                    rates compared to its 6-month counterpart. This can result in significantly more
                                    interest earned over the course of the year, making it an excellent choice for savers
                                    looking to grow their funds.

                                    - **Compounding Benefits:** With a full year for your money to grow, the interest earned
                                    can compound, potentially increasing your overall returns. This is especially beneficial
                                    if you choose to reinvest your interest at the end of the term.

                                    - **Security of Principal:** Like the 6-month option, the 12-month fixed deposit offers
                                    a secure way to save. Your principal is protected, providing peace of mind in uncertain
                                    economic times.

                                    - **Predictable Returns:** With a fixed interest rate, you can confidently plan your
                                    finances, knowing exactly how much you will earn by the end of the term.

                                    **Ideal For:**
                                    This deposit is ideal for individuals saving for specific goals, such as a wedding, a
                                    new car, or a down payment on a home. It's also suitable for those looking to build an
                                    emergency fund that they can access after a year without the risk of losing their
                                    principal.

                                    **How to Open a 12-Month Fixed Deposit:**
